--  1. Syntax Error Identification 
SELECT name age FROM employees WHERE salary >= 50000;
-- Answer 1: there is Comma is missing between the name and age column.
SELECT name, age FROM employees WHERE salary >= 50000;

-- 2. Logical Error Detection
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date = '2023-05-01' AND order_date = '2023-05-02';
-- Answer 2: Using AND operator instead of OR is not correct since its mutual exculsion condition
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date = '2023-05-01' OR order_date = '2023-05-02';

-- 3. Performance Optimization
SELECT * FROM sales WHERE amount > 5000;
-- Answer 3: Instead of picking all columns we need customer_id and sales amount alone.
SELECT amount, customer_id FROM sales WHERE amount > 5000;

-- 4. Data Type Mismatch
SELECT * FROM products WHERE price = '100';
-- Answer 4: Here price is kept as string correct it.
SELECT * FROM products WHERE price = 100;

-- 5. Incorrect Join Condition
SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_name;
-- Answer 5: Wrong join condition, it should be department_id instead of name.
SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;

-- 6. Incorrect NULL Handling
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE customer_name != NULL;
-- Answer 6: IS NOT NULL correct instead of != usage.
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE customer_name IS NOT NULL;

-- 7. Incorrect Use of Aggregate Functions
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount)
FROM sales;
-- Answe7: Use Group By for aggregate the function.
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total_amount
FROM sales
GROUP BY customer_id;

-- 8. Incorrect Column Selection
SELECT order_id, customer_address
FROM orders;
-- Answer 8: There is no column named as customer_address. Give existing column.
SELECT order_id, customer_name
FROM orders;
